Securio.us is a small consulting shop that specializes in web application security testing. Our testing methodology identifies vulnerabilities covered by the OWASP Top 10 and the WASC Threat Classification. Our consultants are GSEC certified. We test running applications and attempt to subvert security controls by manipulating application inputs. We gather the resulting vulnerabilities that we identify into a final report and walk through this document to be sure you understand the issues. Verification of findings may be added as an additional cost. We operate on a wide variety of languages, platforms and technologies. We can test web appliations, web services, and mobile apps on iOS and Android.<BR />
<BR />
We are located in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. If you would like to reach us, please contact us by phone at &#x34;&#x31;&#x35;&#x2e;&#x38;&#x38;&#x39;&#x2e;&#x38;&#x38;&#x31;&#x35;
